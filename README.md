# Mercari-Price-Suggestion-Challenge

## Overview
For a subscription business, accurately predicting churn is critical to long-term success. Even slight variations in churn can drastically affect profits.

KKBOX is Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They offer a generous, unlimited version of their service to millions of people, supported by advertising and paid subscriptions. This delicate model is dependent on accurately predicting churn of their paid users.

In this competition, KKBOX’s challenging you to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will churn after their subscription expires.
